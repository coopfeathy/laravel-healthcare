## 11.0.0 - 2022-06-30

### Changed

- #2243 Simplified project structure:
- 
- Before:
- 
- ```
- excludes
-     af.php
-     ...
- locales
-     af
-         af.json
-         auth.php
-         pagination.php
-         passwords.php
-         validation-inline.php
-         validation.php
-         validation-nova-inline.php
-         validation-nova.php
- source
-     packages
-         framework
-             laravel-5.json
-             laravel-6.json
-             ...
-         breeze.json
-         cashier.json
-         ...
-     auth.php
-     pagination.php
-     passwords.php
-     validation-inline.php
-     validation.php
- 
- ```
- After:
- 
- ```
- locales
-     af
-         _excludes.json
-         json.json
-         json-inline.json
-         php.json
-         php-inline.json
- source
-     breeze
-         1.x
-             breeze.json
-     framework
-         extended.json
-         6.x
-             framework.json
-         7.x
-             framework.json
-     laravel
-         6.x
-             auth.php
-             pagination.php
-             passwords.php
-             validation.php
-     ...
- 
- ```
- Now the project can store translations for different versions of the project. For example, in Laravel 9 the validation.password key is an array, while in older versions it is a string.
- 
- ```
- "password": "Le mot de passe est incorrect",
- "password.letters": "The :attribute must contain at least one letter.",
- "password.mixed": "The :attribute must contain at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter.",
- "password.numbers": "The :attribute must contain at least one number.",
- "password.symbols": "The :attribute must contain at least one symbol.",
- "password.uncompromised": "The given :attribute has appeared in a data leak. Please choose a different :attribute.",
- 
- ```
- Laravel 8:
- 
- ```php
- // validation.php
- 
- return [
-     'password' => 'The password is incorrect.',
- ],
- 
- ```
- Laravel 9:
- 
- ```php
- // validation.php
- 
- return [
-     'password' => [
-         'letters'       => 'The :attribute must contain at least one letter.',
-         'mixed'         => 'The :attribute must contain at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter.',
-         'numbers'       => 'The :attribute must contain at least one number.',
-         'symbols'       => 'The :attribute must contain at least one symbol.',
-         'uncompromised' => 'The given :attribute has appeared in a data leak. Please choose a different :attribute.',
-     ],
- ],
- 
- ```
- Using the 14th version of our [`publisher`](https://publisher.laravel-lang.com/installation/), he himself can determine the installed version and use the necessary keys.
- 
- Now we don't need to manually create the inline translation source file. When an occurrence in the :attribute string is found, the script will automatically collect such values and create keys for inline translations.
- 
- Added automatic download and copying of translation files to the project. This will keep the keys up to date across multiple versions. For example, Laravel 6, 7, 8 and 9.
