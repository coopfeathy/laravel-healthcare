# Copy files

> When installing the package this way, you will need to manually copy the files from the `vendor/laravel-lang/lang` folder into your application.
>
> If you want to automate the process, then use one of the [`publishers`](managers.md).

After adding the dependency using composer (as described above) to your application you can find the language files under the
directory `vendor/laravel-lang/lang`.

Copy the folders (and JSON files) of languages that you want to use, into the directory `resources/lang` of your Laravel application (or `app/lang` in Laravel
4).
