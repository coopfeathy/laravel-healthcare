> When installing the package this way, you will need to manually copy the files from the `vendor/laravel-lang/lang` folder into your application.
>
> If you want to automate the process, then use one of the [`publishers`](managers.md).

* Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Laravel-Lang/lang/) : *git clone https://github.com/Laravel-Lang/lang.git*
* Or download the [zip file](https://github.com/Laravel-Lang/lang/archive/master.zip)
* Choose the branch:
    * `laravel4` for Laravel 4 project
    * `master` for Laravel 5, 6, 7, 8 projects
* Copy the folders of languages that you want, in `resources/lang` folder of your Laravel application (or `app/lang` in Laravel 4).
